## Blue to Red

You are blue, and are surrounded by other blue people: swirling together in a dot, identical and indistinguishable. From somewhere above you hear the ticking of a clock, and suddenly find yourself and some of your fellows pulled upwards, sucked through a tube arcing high above. As you speed through the tube you see that your dot is one of many: all with blue, some with flecks of red. You see many tubes arcing from dot to dot, all of varying widths and capacities. Your tube journey ends in another, larger dot  and you swirl around with more blue people.  

You see a flash of red ahead of you, and see that actually it is a red person!  You brush against the red person and you start to turn red as well. You feel strange - you are infected. 

The clock ticks again and you find yourself pulled back through the tube to your home dot. Swirling there for several ticks you gradually turn red as you see others pulled away and returned via the tube; only a small number, and seemingly randomly taken each time. You notice several people you touch start to turn red, and that there are more and more red people as the clock ticks onward...

## A Few Bad Apples
Last summer, while trying to decide how best to prevent the cows on my farm from getting sick this year, I had a dream so strange that I felt compelled to write it down. After much thought, I’ve decided to share it, in the hope that it might teach us something.
One moment, I was in bed. Next, I was standing in the middle of the pasture, surrounded by my cows. It felt uncannily real, vivid, and grounded, but something was undeniably off. Then it began.
I had to make a choice—and I had to make it now. Somehow, I could hear the thoughts of all my neighbours, each weighing their own decisions. Some were concerned about the economic costs, how much more expensive it would be to buy cows that had been screened and guaranteed disease-free. Others worried about appearances: What if I’m the only one who cuts corners, and my cows get sick? What would people think? And some had no doubts at all—they believed the only moral choice was to ensure their cows’ health, even if the cost was slightly higher.
But one voice stood out, cold, dismissive: “Who cares if my cows get sick? It won’t hurt my business, and the unchecked ones are cheaper anyway.”
I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Surely it was a hallucination. Was I really hearing the voices of my neighbours? And if so, how could one of them be so… indifferent?
I made my decision. I bought the healthy cows. I even purchased medicine for the few on my farm that had been unwell the year before.
Then, suddenly, a jump in time. I was still in the same spot, but everything had changed. The pasture was fuller, the sick cows looked vibrant and healthy. Leaves had begun to fall, and the air was crisp. It was clearly autumn. It felt impossible.
Within what couldn’t have been more than thirty seconds, things shifted again. It was freezing. Winter. And my once-healthy cows were now gravely ill. I knew this would harm my business, and somehow, I knew the cause: that one neighbour, the one who chose not to care.
Then, just as suddenly, I was back. Summer. Everything reset. It was time again to decide what to do about my cows.
I was confused. A year had passed in what felt like a minute. And once more, I began to hear the voices. But now, the kind voices, the ones that had once insisted on doing the right thing, were quieter, more hesitant. Some seemed to be giving up. Like me, many had seen the consequences of others’ selfish choices ripple through their own lives and herds.
Even though my cows had gotten sick, I knew I had made the right decision. I resolved to do the same as before. However, I sensed that many of my neighbours, especially those who had previously wavered, would opt for the cheaper path this time.
And once more, the cycle began. Fall and then winter within seconds. My cows recovered, then grew ill again. Then back to summer.
Each time the cycle repeated, the voices grew louder. Minutes passed, then hours. And with each cycle, more neighbours grew bitter. They couldn’t understand why their good decisions led to bad outcomes. They watched others make careless, selfish choices and reap rewards. One by one, they abandoned their morals. They stopped choosing what was right and started choosing what was easy—what was cheap—believing that no matter what they did, their cows would suffer anyway.
I woke up in a sweat. I could hardly believe what I had witnessed. In one night, I had seen how a few selfish farmers—bad apples, as I had come to call them could slowly erode the resolve of an entire community. Their disregard for others led even the most reasonable, well-meaning neighbours to forsake their values, making decisions that served only themselves, with no regard for those around them—or for the animals they were meant to care for.

## Blue to Red

You are blue, and are surrounded by other blue people: swirling together in a dot, identical and indistinguishable. From somewhere above you hear the ticking of a clock, and suddenly find yourself and some of your fellows pulled upwards, sucked through a tube arcing high above. As you speed through the tube you see that your dot is one of many: all with blue, some with flecks of red. You see many tubes arcing from dot to dot, all of varying widths and capacities. Your tube journey ends in another, larger dot  and you swirl around with more blue people.  

You see a flash of red ahead of you, and see that actually it is a red person!  You brush against the red person and you start to turn red as well. You feel strange - you are infected. 

The clock ticks again and you find yourself pulled back through the tube to your home dot. Swirling there for several ticks you gradually turn red as you see others pulled away and returned via the tube; only a small number, and seemingly randomly taken each time. You notice several people you touch start to turn red, and that there are more and more red people as the clock ticks onward...
